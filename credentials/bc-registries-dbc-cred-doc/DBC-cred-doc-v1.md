## Credential Overview
The Digital Business Card (DBC) credential is a verifiable credential (VC) issued to individuals to enable them to prove to other parties (“verifiers”) that the individual is affiliated with a business registered or incorporated at BC Registries. Additionally, the credential includes verifiable information about both the individual and the business.

The DBC credential is intended to be used in a wide range of contexts, both alone or in conjunction with other credentials, as a source of trusted information.

## Credential Details

### Issuer

The Digital Business Card credential is issued by the Government of British Columbia through Registries and Online Services (“BC Registries”), part of Service BC in the British Columbia Ministry of Citizens’ Services. BC Registries is responsible for the creation (through incorporation or registration) of businesses, not-for-profit societies, cooperative associations, and sole proprietors (collectively, “businesses”).

BC Registries is responsible for:

- Administering the Partnership Act and Business Corporations Act, including processing filings by businesses (e.g., to register a sole proprietorship or to change the Directors of a corporation) and issuing records
- Operating BC Registries and Online Services, which allows representatives of companies to create accounts, make filings and record requests online, and delegate access to others

### Schema and Credential Definition Governance

The Digital Business Card credential definition implements the Digital Business Card schema (see [Credential Overview](#bookmark=id.35ojgs4iy68y) for references). Both the credential definition and the schema are published by BC Registries, part of Service BC in the British Columbia Ministry of Citizens’ Services. BC Registries may, after any consultation and notification it deems appropriate, update either the credential definition and/or the schema.

### Issuer Data Source

The data in the DBC credential comes from the BC Registries system, which generates the data for some attributes and receives from external sources the data for other attributes. Possible data sources are:

- **Business Filing** – the information is provided from a filing made by or on behalf of the business to BC Registries, as part of the business’ requirement to keep its information current as part of its obligation under the relevant legislation (e.g.,[Partnership Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96348_01), [Business Corporations Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/02057_00))
- **BC Registries system** – these include system generated information, such as identifiers and timestamps, as well as information derived from user actions (e.g., which individual was the person who created the business in the BC Registries system)
- **BC Services Card digital identity** – the identity information about the individual is created when the individual first accesses the BC Registries system using their BC Services Card digital identity and authenticator. The BC Services Card digital identity is a high assurance credential, with the individual’s name matching the name on their foundational identity document
- **Canada Revenue Agency** – the information is provided to the BC Registries system directly from a CRA system

The source of each attribute is described in the [Attributes](#bookmark=id.d4k15yq1kvi3) section.

#### Data Updates

When a DBC credential is issued, its data reflects the current records in BC Registries’ system. Changes to those records will trigger a revocation (and often re-issuance) of the credential to ensure the credential continues to reflect the identity record; these cases are described in further detail in the section on Revocation, below.

### Assurance

In order to minimize risk to BC Registries, verifiers, companies, and the individuals who represent companies, in the initial production release MVP phase (minimum valuable product), the DBC credential will only be issued to individuals when BC Registries is confident in both:

- Their identity
- Their relationship to the business

For this reason, in the MVP, the only individuals who may obtain a DBC credential from BC Registries are:

- Sole Proprietorship Business Owners who accessed the new Business Registries system using the BC Services Card mobile application and self-registered their own proprietorship

#### BC Services Card

The BC Services Card digital identity is used by BC Registries for both its identity information and the security of its two-factor authentication. By design, the BC Services Card digital identity meets the BC Office of the CIO [_Identity Assurance Standard_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/identity_assurance_standard.pdf) requirements for a High (3) Identity Assurance Level. The BC Services Card digital identity has been assessed twice, in 2019 and 2021, by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) against the Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PSP-PCTF). In both cases, it was assessed as being a Trusted Digital Identity Level 3 (high), as defined in Appendix A of the TBS [_Directive on Identity Management_](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16577).

### Revocation

A DBC credential will be revoked in the following cases:

1. The individual is issued a new DBC credential for a business for which they already have been issued one or more credentials. An individual may only have one active DBC credential for a given business at a time, and when they are issued a new one, all previously issued active DBC credentials will be revoked.
1. A rare event has occurred, such as a change to the company identifier or the business is administratively dissolved by the Registrar

A DBC credential will be revoked and re-issued in the following cases:

1. The individual’s identity information is updated in the BC Registries system
1. The individual’s role at the business is updated in the BC Registries system
1. The Business Name or CRA Business Number is updated in the BC Registries system
1. The business dissolves itself in the BC Registries system – the new DBC credential will have an updated Company Status attribute

## Credential Definition

### Credential Schema

The Digital Business Card credential is based on the Digital Business Card schema. Both are published and maintained by the province of British Columbia.

### Subject of the Credential

The subject of the Digital Business Card credential is a relationship, the affiliation of an individual to a business.

- The individual is the person to whom the credential is issued, i.e., its holder
- The affiliation is derived from the individual’s access to the business’ account in the BC Registries system and information BC Registries has about that individual’s relationship to the business, such as their role (e.g., proprietor, director)

In future, authorization may also come from another individual who has been granted to issue the credentials by the business.

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Attributes about the Individual

The DBC credential includes the business contact name for the individual, as well as their role with the business, if any has been filed with BC Registries.

The DBC credential gets the values for its name attribute from the BC Services Card Program, which obtains them from the individual’s Canadian foundational identity documents. Due to limitations in the source systems of the BC Services Card program partners, some individual’s names – in the BC Services Card and by extension the DBC credential – will not match what is on their foundational identity documents in the following cases:

- If an individual's name has a special character (e.g., Á, Ê, Ç) or a number in their name on their foundational identity document, it will not be reflected in the name attributes of the Person credential
- The name in the Person credential will normally reflect the name on foundational identity documents, but those documents may not reflect the individual’s name. For example:
  - Some names have special characters that the BC Vital Statistics will not accept and print on a birth certificate
  - Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will truncate an individual’s name (the combined given names and family name) at 45 characters on IIRC foundational identity documents (e.g., permanent resident card and the student, work, visitor, and temporary-resident permits)
- An individual may use the last name of their spouse without getting a legal name change. In these cases, their Person credential should reflect their foundational identity documents, as individuals are required by law to update their BC Services Card when they change their name by marriage or otherwise. Individuals who do this may continue to use their original name in other contexts, and so their Person credential may not be consistent with their other identity documents or credentials bearing their name

Note that the Person credential gets the values for its name attribute values from the BC Services Card and so has the same data limitations as the BC Services Card.

            <li>To work around the removal of spaces, described above, a first name with a space (e.g. “JO ANNE”) may be entered as a first name and a middle name (e.g., “JO ANNE” is entered as “JO” and “ANNE”). This will appear as “JO ANNE” in the given_names attribute, which is indistinguishable from an individual whose first name is “JO” and whose middle name is “ANNE”. Similarly, a middle name with a space (e.g., “MARY LOU”) may be entered as two middle names (e.g., “MARY” and “LOU”). As such, spaces in the given_names attribute are not a reliable delimiter between names</li>
            <li>Some legacy records have only an initial for a middle name (e.g., "J" for "James")</li>
            <li>A mononym may be duplicated in this attribute and the family_name unless it has a space in it, in which case the first part may be recorded in this attribute and the second part in the family_name attribute</li>
