# BC Petroleum Natural Gas Title Governance Framework (Primary Document)

# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1 Introduction

The majority of subsurface petroleum and natural gas resources in British Columbia (BC) are owned by the Province. By entering into a tenure agreement with the Province, private industry can develop these resources. Tenure agreements with the Province give private developers rights to petroleum and natural gas resources through Petroleum and Natural Gas Titles. Information can be found on the [BC Government Petroleum and Natural Gas Tenure Site](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-gas-oil/petroleum-natural-gas-tenure).


Legislation and regulations govern the disposition, administration and management of petroleum and natural gas [BC Petroleum and Natural Gas Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/00_96361_01). 

The development of this documentation follows the governance framework created by the [Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/) [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf) created by the [Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group).

## 1.2. Terminology and Notation

Please reference [Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary).

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

- Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT or REQUIRED keyword.
- Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.
- Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

## 1.3. Localization

The contact for petitioners and relying parties of this GF during the pilot phase of the project is


## 1.5. Administering Authority

[Energy, Mines and Digital Trust (EMDT)](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt) is the Administering Authority on behalf the The Tenure and Resource Stewardship Branch during the pilot phase of development.

## 1.6 Purpose 

The structure of the credential contains all information needed to fullfill a BC Petroleum and Natural Gas Title. These systems and governance will allow for a more trustworthy ecosystem. The purpose of this governance framework is to outline all rules associated with the BC Petroleum and Natural Gas Title Credential. 

## 1.7 Scope

This Governance Framework (GF) is to define the parameters of a digital BC Petroleum and Natural Gas Title Credential. 

## 1.8 Objectives 

This GF describes the BC Petroleum and Natural Gas Title Credential consisting of all data elements included in a BC Petroleum and Natural Gas Title Document. 

## 1.9 Principles 

Currently, the oil and gas industry works within a [framework of principles](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-gas-oil/responsible-oil-gas-development) and [regulations](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96361_01) that govern and guide operations – especially as they relate to safety, land and water use, surface and mineral rights and environmental impacts. 

## 1.10 General Requirements

*This section is reserved for policies that apply generally to the GF as a whole, and not just in the context of a particular controlled document. This policy appies generally to the entire trust community*

When petroleum and natural gas operators wish to obtain a Petroleum and Natural Gas Title in BC, a Petroleum and Natural Gas Title Document must be provided in accordance with the BC Petroleum and Natural Gas Act. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Title Credential must be issued by EMLI (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation) Tenure and Resource Stewardship Branch.

## 1.11. Revisions
Version 1.0. This governance document has the potential to be revised and improved in the future. The governance framework is designed for change as mandated in the ToIP Metamodel. Specific revisions will be decided at a later date pending review. 

## 1.12. Extensions
There are no extensions to this Governance Framework. Currently during this Pilot Phase, there is not a well defined definition of how this governance is extended. In the future extension of the governance framework with other governance frameworks at the same layer or other layers will be defined.

| | | | | **Tract Rights** Following Tract Location is a description called Tract Rights. This section defines rights as either "Included (I)" or "Excluded (E)". Zone names are coded  "Petroleum (P)" "Petroleum Natural Gas (PNG)" or "". Each right will be denoted by its corresponding letter. This section outlines the rights associated with each individual tract listed on a PNG title document. This would be linked with a BC business number (i.e. BC123456). Tract rights are identified using specific Code Lists. There are Stratigraphic Codes (used to define tract rights) and Standard Zone Designations. 
| | | | |**Stratigraphic Codes** are used to define tract rights.  The Stratigraphic Codes outline (1) Strata Zone Codes (2) Descriptions (3) Effective Dates and (4) Expiry Dates. 
| | | | | **Strata Zone Code TT** To Top Of 
| | | | | **Strata Zone Code TB** To Base Of

These codes outline (1) a standard 5 digit code (3) descriptions of this code including descriptions of geographical areas and details (4) shortened descriptions of these details (5) effective dates (6) expiry dates.

| | | | | **Tract Notes** Following the description of Tract Rights is a section called Tract Notes. Tract Notes outlines specific notes or points associated with each tract. Definitions of zones used in tract rights reference specific depth intervals in the type well named in the same note. _Specify format used_. These are used to describe the type wells and the intervals in the type wells that are used to create the type. 
Caveats | caveats | String | not NULL | Caveats provide information and guidance to the tenure holder that will assist in activity planning by identifying potential access restrictions. Caveats will also flag concerns identified through pre-tenure consultation and may recommend engagement with First Nations, stakeholders, and other agencies as appropriate. Caveats often point to relevant statute and policy and are not binding or enforced by the Ministry.
