# BC Major Mines Office Governance Framework - DRAFT
# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1 Introduction

This document articulates the governance framework for BC Major Mines Office as a participant of the open global community that exchanges verifiable credentials [(layer four application of the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) model)](https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/)

The development of this documentation follows the governance framework created by the [Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/) [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf) created by the [Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group).

This governance framework includes structural elements from the Trust over IP Metamodel that were developed by Governance Stack Working Group of the Trust over IP Foundation, the eSSIF Lab Glossary and Mental Models, were contributed to the Trust Over IP Foundation under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.  There have also been contributions from the Concepts & Terminology Working Group at ToIP, the Human Experience Working Group at ToIP and the Ecosystem Foundry Working Group at ToIP, the work of the Governance Framework Working Group at Sovrin Foundation is also acknowledged in providing support.
## 1.2. Terminology and Notation

Please reference [Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary).

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

- Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT or REQUIRED keyword.
- Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.
- Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

[BC Mines Act Definitions](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96293_01#section1)

*  **Credential Holders**: These are the mining operators within BC
*  **Major Mines**: Moderate- to large- scale mineral and coal mining operations, including sand and gravel pits, quarries, and placer mines.
* 	**Coordinated Authorizations** are referred by the Chief Permitting Officer (CPO) to manage projects that require multiple permits – for example, a Mines Act permit to construct and operate an outfall and an [EMA (Environmental Management Act)](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/03053_01) permit to discharge from it. There are three different routes for a project to come into the coordinated 
authorizations process:
      1. Any new mineral or coal mine project, whether or not reviewable under the [Environmental 
Assessment Act (EAA)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/water/laws-rules/environmental-assessment-act);
      2. A mine project that is an extension, expansion, or re-start requiring multiple 
authorizations;
      3. Any project that the CPO determines would benefit from the coordinated authorizations 
process due to its complexity.
* 	**Major Mines Office (MMO)** All construction and operations permit applications for coal and mineral mines are managed by the Ministry's Major Mines Office (MMO) and must be submitted through the MMO’s intake email permrecl@gov.bc.ca.
* 	**Mine Manager** the person authorized to act on behalf of the mine operations. This person is responsible for secure access to MineSpace portal.
* 	**Mines Digital Services (MDS)** System designed for easier access for the public, industry and government to see what's happening in the mining industry across British Columbia. 
* 	**MineSpace** A part of the MDS system, developed specifically for industry. It is intended to make it easier for businesses to manage applications, see their inspection history and submit reports.
* 	**CORE** A central digital repository for all major mine record information. 

## 2.2. Risk Assessment
TBD

## 2.3. Trust Assurance and Certification
TBD

## 2.4. Governance Requirements

## 2.5. Business Requirements

## 2.5.1. Establishment of Connection

1. The Mine Manager of the interested mining company MUST access the MineSpace portal in order to request a single-use invitation link to connect (*note, trust assurance is based on the process the Mine Manager must follow in order to access MineSpace portal - includes BCeID, etc*.)
2. The Mine Manager MUST select the option to request an invitation link from the MineSpace portal homepage for the required mining company (not for the mine site, this is the organizational link). Backend note - MineSpace MUST send the invitation request to Traction in order to generate a single-use invitation link. Traction MUST return the invitiation link to MineSpace, the invitation link WILL display within the MineSpace homescreen.
3. MineSpace MUST return the invitation link to the mining company's homepage.
4. The Mine Manager MUST use the invitation link provided within their organizational wallet in order to establish a secure connection.
5. Traction MUST send/request? approval notification to CORE (*further discussion required*)

## 2.5.2. Major Mines Operating Permit - Digital Credential Request (Existing)
When mining operators wish to obtain a BC Mines Act Permit in BC, they must adhere to the [Mines Act Permiting Process](https://mines.nrs.gov.bc.ca/authorizations). The Mines Act permitting process includes on-site activities, such as the management of water quality, waste and metal leaching and acid rock drainage at the mine, as well as, geotechnical design and reclamation and closure planning. 

1. Using the established connection, the mining company MUST send a credential request to MDS.
2. Continuing from step 1, the mining company MUST provide all of the following attributes in the credential request as outlined in the [BC Mines Act Permit](https://github.com/bcgov/bc-vcpedia/blob/Mines-Act-Permit/credentials/credential-bc-mines-act-permit.md):

**BC.Major.Mines.Permit**: permit_id

4. MDS MUST recieve and review the request.
5. Any clarification questions MAY be asked via secure email.
6. MDS SHALL offer a Mines Act Permit Credential to the Mining Company.
7. Mining Company MAY choose to accept the Mines Act Permit credential. 
   
## 2.5.3. Major Mines Operating Permit Application - Digital Credential Request (New)

[The Coordinated Authorizations Process](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/permitting/coordinated-authorizations/mines-process#:~:text=The%20coordinated%20authorizations%20process%20is,detailed%20information%20on%20the%20process.) is defined by four overarching stages: pre-application, screening, review, drafting and decision. 

There are three different routes for a project to come into the Coordinated Authorizations Process:
- Any new mineral or coal mine project, whether or not reviewable under the [Environmental Assessment Act (EAA)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/water/laws-rules/environmental-assessment-act);
- A mine project that is an extension, expansion, or re-start requiring multiple authorizations;
- Any project that the CPO determines would benefit from the Coordinated Authorizations Process due to its complexity.

1. A project that meets the above criteria MUST conduct introductions and engagements among the proponent, Provincial Staff, Indigenous Nations and other potentially impacted groups.
2. A project MAY be referred to the Coordinated Authorizations Process by the Chief Permitting Officer (CPO) after step 1 is complete if deemed necessary after introductions and engagements.
3. All Coordinated Authorizations MUST be managed by the [EMLI Major Mines Office (MMO)](https://mines.nrs.gov.bc.ca/authorizations). 
4. Mines Act Permit Applications that are particularly complex MUST be referred to an advisory committee made up of Provincial staff, Indigenous nations, and other potentially impacted groups through a [Mine Review Committee](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/permitting/coordinated-authorizations/mine-mrc) (MRC) by the CPO as part of the Coordinated Authorizations Process.
5. Application MUST be formally submitted to indigenous nations for review.
6. The MRC MAY subject the application to public engagement activities if required.
7. The MRC MUST provide recommendations to SDMs (Statutory Decision Makers) to support the decision-making process. The intended outcome of the coordinated authorizations process is durable decisions that reflect the interests of all parties involved.
8. Complex projects MUST be coordinated by an EMLI project lead and follow a structured permitting process. 
9. Reports and draft permits MUST be prepared and reviewed by the proponent and MRC.


## 2.6. Technical Requirements (Credential)
*MUST have an Hyperledger Aries compatible business wallet.*

## 2.7. Information Trust Requirements

The [Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96165_00) sets out the access and privacy rights of individuals as they relate to the public sector in British Columbia.

## 2.8. Inclusion, Equitability, and Accessibility Requirements

The [Accessible British Columbia Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/21019) informs [**AccessibleBC**](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility/legislation/accessiblebc)

The [Diversity & Inclusion Strategy for the BC Public Service](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/about-the-bc-public-service/diversity-inclusion/diversity-inclusion-strategy) outlines the committments of BC govenment in supporting inclusion, equitability and access throughout the province.

The [Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (Declaration Act)](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/19044) establishes the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN Declaration) as BC’s framework for reconciliation that respects the human rights of Indigenous Peoples.

## 2.9. Legal Agreements
TBD
