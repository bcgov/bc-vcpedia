# TSM Summary Report Governance Framework (Primary Document)

# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1. Introduction

Established in 2004, the Towards Sustainable Mining™ (TSM) is a globally recognized program developed by the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) to aid mining companies in a standardized way to evaluate and manage their environmental and social responsibilities. The TSM program provides a set of eight (8) [protocols](https://tsminitiative.com/protocols-frameworks) that consist of a set of indicators designed to help mining facilities build, measure and publicly report on the quality of their management systems and performance in key areas of mining activity at the site level. The periodic issuance of TSM reports is required for all members of the [Mining Association of Canada (MAC)](https://mining.ca/). This Governance Framework (GF) documents the TSM Protocol credential and its requirements.

The development of this documentation follows the governance framework created by the [Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/) [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf) created by the [Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group).

## 1.2. Terminology and Notation

Please reference [Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary).

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

- Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT or REQUIRED keyword.
- Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.
- Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

## 1.3. Localization

The standard language for this governing framework (GF) is English.

## 1.4. Governing Authority

[The Mining Association of Canada (MAC)](https://mining.ca/) is the governing authority that leads the development, maintenance, and implementation of the Governance Framework (GF) for TSM. The governance and decision-making process for the TSM program includes the following groups and committees:

* The **TSM Governance Team** is a subcommittee of the MAC Board of Directors. This group is responsible for providing strategic direction on all matters related to TSM and making recommendations to the Board on proposed changes to the program.

* The **MAC Board of Directors** sets the overall objective and recommends changes. In practice, the MAC Board will only consider a decision if the Community of Interest Advisory Panel (COI Panel) is comfortable with the direction proposed.

* The **Community of Interest Advisory Panel (COI Panel)** is an independent advisory body comprised of individuals from Indigenous groups, mining communities, 
non-governmental organizations, and organized labour, among others. Industry representatives participate in the panel on an exofficio basis.

## 1.6. Purpose

The purpose of this Governance Framework (GF) is to define the parameters of a TSM Protocol credential.

## 1.7. Scope

This Governance Framework applies to the TSM Protocol credential from the Mining Association of Canada (MAC).

## 1.8. Objectives

This GF describes the TSM Protocol credential consisting of the eight protocols used as performance indicators (detailed descriptions of the protocols can be accessed online through MAC's Website: [TSM Protocols & Frameworks](https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/protocols-frameworks/)):

TSM describes the following overarching objectives in its [Theory of Change] (Insert static link if Ben is okay with this) 
1) Multi Stakeholder Engagement
2) Continual Improvement
3) Driving Change Across the Mining Industry
4) Credible Performance Reporting

Specific priorities associated with the above objectives include the following:
1. Drive continuous enhancement of on-site sustainability performance through strategic approaches.
2. Drive culture change within national mining industries, establishing processes for regular engagement and collaboration with a diverse set of individuals from national stakeholder and rights holder groups.
3. Encourage company progress from good practice to excellence via a multi-level rating system, supported by TSM protocols for benchmarking and target setting.
4. Enable industry-level monitoring, trend identification, and intervention by using comprehensive TSM reporting data from national mining associations and stakeholders.

The TSM summary credential is a combination of pass/fail scores and letter grades ranging from Level C to Level AAA.

## 1.9. Principles

TSM has a set of [Guiding Principles](https://mining.ca/download/36658/), which all participating members must commit to. These [Guiding Principles](https://mining.ca/download/36658/), address the expectation of its members towards adopting social, economic and environmental practices that align with the priorities and values of their communities of interest. 


## 1.10. General Requirements

### Verification Process

Every three years TSM self-assessed scores are validated by an [appointed TSM Verification Service Provider (VSP)](https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2022/03/2022-March-Verifier-List.pdf). 
More information about the verification process can be found in the [TSM Verification Guide]( https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/12/TSM-Verification-Guide.pdf)

![TSMVerificationLayers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122049466/215434707-681ab0e5-de20-4ab2-8908-04373669a3bd.PNG)

## 1.13. Schedule of Controlled Documents
(input all the guides and links to TSM protocols)

# 2. Controlled Documents

## 2.1. Glossary

*  [**Verification Service Provider (VSP)**](https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/11/2021-TSM-Verifier-Terms-of-Reference.pdf): Independent third-party verifiers act as auditors that validate self-assessed TSM scores. Every three years, a trusted VSP critically reviews a company’s self-assessments to determine if there is adequate evidence to support the performance ratings reported.
*  [**Community of Interest (COI) Advisory Panel**](https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/06/FINAL-2020-COI-Panel-Terms-of-Reference.pdf): Independent multi-interest advisory body comprised of individuals from Indigenous groups, mining communities, non-governmental organizations, and organized labour, among others. The MAC Board also selects a few representatives from the TSM Governance Team to participate in the panel on an ex-officio basis. 
* [**MAC Board of Directors**](https://mining.ca/about-us/board-of-directors/): The Mining Association of Canada (MAC) is governed by a team of industry leaders from our membership who were selected for their breadth and depth of mining experience. Through their strategic guidance and oversight, these professionals collectively play a vital role in advancing the work of MAC and the industry at large.

## 2.2. Risk Assessment
[The Mining Association of Canada (MAC) Board of Directors (Board)](https://mining.ca/about-us/board-of-directors/) is the the primary authority for the risk assessment process of the TSM Programme. The Board relies heavily on the collective expertise and advice from the [Community of Interest (COI) Panel](https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/how-tsm-works/community-of-interest-advisory-panel/). Key issues are identified and presented to the TSM COI Panel. 

## 2.3. Trust Assurance and Certification
  
Trust Assurance and Certification is determined primarily by the [MAC Board of Directors](https://mining.ca/about-us/board-of-directors/). The [TSM Community of Interest (COI) Panels](https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/how-tsm-works/community-of-interest-advisory-panel/) is an independent, multi-interest group comprised of about 12 to 15 individuals from Aboriginal groups, communities where the industry is active, environmental and social NGOs, and labor and financial organizations that advises the MAC Board of Directors.

MAC utilizes the **MUTUAL COOPERATION AND LICENSING AGREEMENT RESPECTING THE USE AND APPLICATION OF TSM** as a trust assurance framework for international adoption. MAC has identified the following minimum categories of requirements for Licensees: 
1.	Guiding Principles
2.	Performance Indicators
3.	Facility-level Reporting
4.	Independent Verification
5.	Public Reporting of Facility Level Reporting 
6.	Community of Interest Advisory Body
7.	Condition of Membership

## 2.4. Governance Requirements
The TSM Protocol Credential is governed by the [**TSM Program Governance**](https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/12/TSM-Program-Governance.pdf) 

## 2.5. Business Requirements

The primary use of the TSM Protocol Credential is verification of TSM scores, see [Mining Association of Canada (MAC) Verifier Governance Framework](https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/external-verification/#:~:text=Individuals%20interested%20in%20becoming%20TSM%20verifiers%20should%20confirm,Mining%20Association%20of%20Canada%E2%80%99s%20annual%20verifier%20training%20workshop.)
